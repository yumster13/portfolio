## For Unix users
If you want to have the best experience, we recommend that you set your terminal's width and height to have the game board cover the entire terminal window.

You can either resize it by dragging the corners or by setting concrete values in the terminal settings.

To do so :
1. Open your terminal's settings menu.
2. Select 'Preferences'.
3. Go To `Unnamed`.
4. Set you prefered terminal size.
